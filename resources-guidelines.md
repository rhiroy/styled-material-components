## Why Styled Material Components?

* what are the alternative options for implementing styling in React?
* when was styled-components created? what was the problem it was trying to solve?
* why are we doing styled-material-components since it seems like Material UI is doing the same thing?
* what is the advantage of styled-components that Material UI lacks?
	* It's pretty neat! MUI works great out of the box. But...there's one small thing: it's not infinitely customizable.
	* This is hard to appreciate if you haven't used MUI and run up against its limits, but you cannot completely customize. 

* Does styled-material-components unify the advantages of styled-components and Material UI.
